  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This app does not collect, store, sell, or share personal data. It provides links to official government public notice pages

    from your chosen subscriptions. Notification settings can be changed in iOS Settings &rarr; Notifications.

  <h2>Calendar Access</h2>

    If you choose to add a notice to your calendar, the app requests calendar permission to create the event locally on your device.
